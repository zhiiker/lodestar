It's people like you that push the Ethereum ecosystem forward. Prerequisites \u00b6 Lerna Yarn Getting Started \u00b6 Run lerna bootstrap or yarn install to install dependencies NOTE: By default the spec tests (5GB) will be installed with other dependencies. If you would like to avoid downloading the spec tests, instead run yarn install --ignore-optional . Tests \u00b6 Run lerna run test:spec-min for minimal spec tests Run lerna run test:spec-main for mainnet spec tests Run lerna run test:unit for unit tests Run lerna run test:e2e for end-to-end tests Run lerna run test to run all tests First-time Contributor? \u00b6 Unsure where to begin contributing to Lodestar? Here are some ideas! See any typos? See any verbiage that should be changed or updated? Go for it! Github makes it easy to make contributions right from the browser. Look through our outstanding unassigned issues . (hint: look for issues labeled \"good first issue\") Join our discord chat ! Reporting a bug? \u00b6 Create a new issue! Select the type of issue that best fits, and please fill out as much of the information as you can. Contribution process \u00b6 Make sure you're familiar with our contribution guidelines (this document!) Create your own fork of this repo Make your changes in your local fork If you've made a code change, make sure to lint and test your changes ( yarn lint and yarn test:unit ) Make a pull request! We review PRs on a regular basis. You may be asked to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). We make it relatively painless with CLA-bot. Lodestar Monorepo \u00b6 We're currently experimenting with hosting the majority of lodestar packages and support packages in this repository as a monorepo . We're using Lerna to manage the packages. See packages/ for a list of packages hosted in this repo. Style Guide \u00b6 PRs should usually only update a single package (in our monorepo) at a time Many module class constructors have the following signature: (options, dependencies) eg: public constructor(opts: IExampleOptions, {db, logger}: IExampleModules) Modules should be designed to \"do one thing and do it well\" Consider the interface of a module -- events included, and make sure it is coherent Make sure your code is properly linted use an IDE that will show linter errors/warnings run yarn lint from the command line common rules: Functions and variables should be camelCase , classes should be PascalCase , constants should be UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES . Use \" instead of ' All functions should have types declared for all parameters and return value All interfaces should be prefixed with a I eg: IMyInterface You probably shouldn't be using Typescript's any Private class properties should not be prefixed with a _ eg: private dirty; , not private _dirty; Make sure that your code is properly type checked: use an IDE that will show type errors run yarn check-types from the command line Make sure that the tests are still passing: run yarn test:unit from the command line Community \u00b6 Come chat with us on discord !","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#introduction","text":"Thanks for your contribution to Lodestar.
